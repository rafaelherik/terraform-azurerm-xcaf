## Manifesto

This is a project to create a different way to implement Azure Cloud Adoption Framework using Terraform. Microsoft launched Azure Verified Modules, but this initiative is not complete and some modules are not available. 
This project is a way to fill the gap and provide a different way to implement Azure Cloud Adoption Framework using Terraform.

This project is following the principles of:

- [Azure Landing Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) 
- [Azure Landing Zone Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Landing-Zone-Accelerator).
- [Azure Verified Modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/) - All the modules are implementing the interfaces of Azure Verified Modules.


## Disclaimer
>[!IMPORTANT]
This project is not affiliated with Microsoft. It is a personal project to fill the gap of Azure Verified Modules. Use it at your own risk.
